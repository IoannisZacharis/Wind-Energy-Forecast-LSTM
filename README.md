 LSTM TIMESERIES FORECASTING

Development of a LSTM NN model for timeseries data forecast.
Basically it's about the creation of an LSTM model, that its data are time sensitive such as wind.
We developed an algorithm that uses the previous output of the model o create the next input in the right format.
We have also intoduced to the model time dependencies and patterns that are helpfull for increasing the forecast's accuracy.
